Creating a feature-rich notes app with React for learning purposes

# 📝 Enhanced Notes App
This is a notes-taking app built with **React** and **Vite**.  
I'm using this project as a way to **learn and practice React**, building components, managing state, working with local storage, and creating beautiful UIs with **Tailwind CSS**.

## 🚀 Features
- **✍️ Add & Edit Notes** - Create new notes and edit existing ones inline
- **🔍 Search Functionality** - Find notes quickly with real-time search
- **🗑️ Delete Notes** - Remove notes you no longer need
- **📅 Timestamps** - See when notes were created and last updated
- **💾 Persistent Storage** - Notes are saved to the browser's local storage
- **⌨️ Keyboard Shortcuts** - Press Enter to save, Escape to cancel editing
- **📱 Responsive Design** - Works great on desktop and mobile
- **🎨 Modern UI** - Beautiful gradient backgrounds, smooth animations, and hover effects
- **🔄 Smart Date Formatting** - Shows "Today", "Yesterday", or days ago
- **📊 Note Statistics** - See total note count and search results

## 🎨 Design Features
- **Gradient backgrounds** and modern card-based layout
- **Smooth animations** and hover transitions
- **Icon integration** using Lucide React
- **Empty state messaging** for better user experience
- **Visual feedback** for all user interactions

## 📚 What I Learned
Through building this project, I've practiced:
- **React Hooks** - useState, useEffect, useRef for state management
- **Local Storage** - Persisting data in the browser
- **Component Architecture** - Breaking down UI into reusable pieces
- **Event Handling** - Managing user interactions and keyboard events
- **Conditional Rendering** - Showing different UI states
- **Array Methods** - Filtering, mapping, and manipulating note data
- **Modern CSS** - Flexbox, CSS Grid, and Tailwind utility classes
- **User Experience** - Creating intuitive and responsive interfaces

## 🛠️ Built With
- ⚛️ **React** - Component-based UI library
- ⚡ **Vite** - Fast build tool and dev server
- 🎨 **Tailwind CSS** - Utility-first CSS framework
- 🔗 **Lucide React** - Beautiful icon library
- 💾 **Local Storage API** - Browser storage for persistence

## 📱 Usage
